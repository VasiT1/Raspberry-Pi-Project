# Raspberry-Pi-Project

Our team has worked on a project named "Baba Yaga", which was inspired by the Slavic mythology. This project features a house that resembles home of the folklore character named Baba Yaga. This house is equipped with chicken legs that move up and down in sync with music played through a speaker. We wanted to create something unique and what everyone would remember, and the idea of creating the moving audio speaker was an unexpected solution. The project require many different skills, for example 3D Modeling, programming and others, so each team member had something to do.

The code provided opens the music stream and then checks if there any music, after which it would give command for servo to move. Used ssh server to connect phone to raspberry console and run the code or to shutdown the raspberry.
